        <P class=normalpara>The new features and resolved issues addressed between the 3.9.2.44 and 3.9.2.45 versions of the Spectrum24 11Mbps Wireless LAN Software include:
    	<UL>
	<P><b>New Feature</b></P>
        <LI>
        <P><b>WHQL Certification</b> - The Symbol LA-4121 PC Card has been Windows Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL) certified for 
	interoperability with Microsoft Windows XP.</P>

	<P><b>Resolved Issues</b></P>      	
        <LI>
        <P>A PSK-TKIP Symbol Client can now associate properly to a Symbol ESSID configured for PSK-TKIP and WPA TKIP.</P>
	<LI>
        <P>The Symbol Mobile Companion utility uses a third party protocol by the Massachusetts 
	Institute of Technology (MIT) for Kerberos authentication. MIT found a memory leak problem
	in their Kerberos software and have since fixed the issue. Symbol, in turn, has 
	implemented the fix into the Mobile Companion utility.</p>
	<LI>
        <P>A new Mobile Companion installer (containing SymbolGina.dll ver 1.0.0.5) now locates the Symbol GINA 
	included with Mobile Companion when the PC (Windows XP system with SP #1) is rebooted. The error message
	no longer displays at boottime.  
	</UL>

        2004)</u></b> </font> 
        <P class=normalpara></P>
        <font color="#204080">The new features and resolved issues addressed between 
        the 3.7.0.94 and 3.9.2.44 versions of the Spectrum24 11Mbps Wireless LAN 
        Software include: </font>
<UL>
	<P><b>New Features</b></P>
       	<LI>
	<P><b>WiFi Protected Access (WPA) </b> - Support for WPA security modes, including Pre-Shared Key (PSK) and 802.1x authentication.</P>
 	<LI>
	<P><b>KeyGuard-MCM </b>- Support for KeyGuard-MCM dynamic encryption key security. </P>
 	<LI>
	<P><b>Kerberos Logon Improvements </b>- Kerberos authentication is provided through the Symbol GINA. 
	The Symbol GINA acts as a filter passing user-entered credentials to the Kerberos Module.</P>
	<LI>
	<P><b>Kerberos Credentials Caching  </b>- A user's Kerberos credentials (username, password and domain) can be 
	cached using the Mobile Companion utility. </P>
 	<LI>
	<P><b>Mobile Companion or Driver Only Installation Options </b>- Symbol recommends using Mobile Companion as the adapter management utility. 
	If, however, a third party software supplicant is being used, a driver only installer is available 
	for use with the Windows provided Zero Config utility as the software management tool.</P>
 	<LI>
	<P><b>Windows Mobile 2003 Operating System Support </b>- Spectrum24 802.11b 11Mbps software now provides driver and Mobile Companion 
	adapter management software for the Windows Mobile 2003 operating system to support the latest 
	handheld computing devices.</P>

	<P><b>Resolved Issues</b></P>      	
       	<LI>
        <P>Mobile Companion no longer allows Kerberos to be selectable when Ad Hoc is enabled as the adapter operating mode. </P>
        <LI>
        <P>When there are more than 11 adapter profiles created with Mobile Companion, the user is now able 
	to move to the bottom of the WLAN Profile page using the "move down in list" icons.</P>
        <LI>
        <P>The Symbol LA-4137 Wireless Networker no longer experiences hangs when running WEP.</P>
        <LI>
        <P>Symbol LA-4123 PCI adapters are now able to "wake up" properly when set to DHCP.</p> 
 	<LI>
        <P>Pocket PC 2003 keyboard icons no longer disappear when configuring Kerberos.</p>
	<LI>
        <P>Compaq Ipaq 3835 model Pocket PCs can now display the adapter ESSID in Mobile Companion 
	after re-installing the Spectrum24 software on top of an existing version.</P>
	</UL>
  
	<A id=Known_Issues name=Known_Issues></A><SPAN 
        class=normalpara></SPAN><BR></P></LI></UL>
      <P class=normalpara><U><STRONG>Known Issues</STRONG></U> </P>
      
      <P class=normalpara>The following issues remain outstanding or are outstanding with a 
	workaround for both the 3.9.2.45 and 3.9.2.46 releases:
	<UL>
        <LI>
        <P>A second Mobile Companion icon could appear in the task tray after the initial Mobile 
	Companion installation. The second icon does not affect performance or functionality of either 
	Mobile Companion or the Symbol adapter.</P>
        <LI>
        <P>If using a Symbol LA-4121 PC card or LA-4137 CF adapter in a Windows XP system, 
	the adapter does not appear as a device that can be safely unplugged or ejected. This does 
	not impact performance or functionality. The adapter can be removed safely at any time.</P>
        <LI>
        <P>The Known Access Points property page could have an empty display even when the device 
	is assoicated to an access point. This false display occurs if the access point does not 
	enable the ESSID field in the beacon. This does not affect performance or roaming.</P>
        <LI>
        <P>On Windows Mobile 2003 systems using Zero Config, the following error 
	message appears when configuring 802.1x/PEAP authentication: "Cannot log 
	onto the wireless network - requires personal certificate. Contact Network Administrator.". 
	This warning displays even though the authentication is successful. This is a known issue with 
	the Mobile 2003 operating system.</P>
        <LI>
        <P>When a Symbol adapter is associated to an AP set to mandatory association, the 
	Symbol adapter attempts to associate to another AP if it goes out of range of the defined 
	mandatory AP. This behavior is by Symbol design. The Mandatory association feature is not 
	recommended in environments where roaming between APs is required. Mandatory association is 
	designed to test the range and association between a wireless client and AP and should not be 
	used during normal operation.</P>
        <LI>
        <P>A "Call to WZCEnumInterfaces failed to get adapter info" error could display on 
	Windows Mobile 2003 devices after a cold-boot if using PEAP authentication. Cold-boot 
	persistence is not supported for PEAP or any authentication type requiring Certificates.</P>
        <LI>
        <P>Windows Mobile 2003 device fields clear after about 20 seconds when a PEAP username, 
	password and domain credentials are entered within the Network Logon screen. This is a Windows 
	Mobile 2003 design issue. Every effort should be made to enter the required information within 20 
	seconds.</P>
        <LI>
        <P>When creating a Kerberos enabled adapter profile, only four entries can be 
	added for "At(hh:mm)" on the Prompt for Username/Password at window.</P>
        <LI>
        <P>The password field on the Symbol GINA appears to have a space on the left. 
	The space does not affect performance or functionality.</P>
	<LI>
 	<P>After changing users with Fast User Switching in Windows XP, the Mobile Companion 
	icon does not appear in the task tray. When switching back to the original user, the icon displays. 
	Mobile Companion does not support Fast User Switching.</P>
	<LI>
	<P>Do not unzip both the Mobile Companion and Driver Only installer folders to the same subdirectory.
	The installation will not work properly and one of the folders will need to be 
	removed in order for the desired installer to function correctly.</P>
	<P><b>Known Issues with Workarounds</b></P>  
	<LI>
        <P>On HP NX 9010 notebook computers installed with Mobile Companion or driver-only installations 
	using a Symbol LA-4121 PC card adapter, the computer hangs on boot up if the adapter is inserted. 
	The hang is caused by a memory resource conflict. To fix this conflict, install Mobile Companion or 
	complete the driver only installation and remove the adapter. Boot up the computer. Insert the card. 
	Open the Device Manager. Show hidden devices. Select the Symbol LA-4121 PC Card and open its properties. 
	Click on the Resources tab. Select Memory Range Resource. Unselect "Use Automatic Settings" and 
	click "Change Settings...". Change the value fields to a different range until there are no conflicts 
	with other devices. Click OK to save the changes. A dialog box displays prompting "Do you want to 
	Continue?" Click Yes. </P>
        <LI>
        <P>LA-4137 Wireless Networker installations on PPC devices running the Mobile 2003 operating 
	system have been observed to lose their keyboard display when Kerberos is enabled on the device. 
	If this occurs, tap the grey spotted area on the bottom of the screen to restore the keyboard. </P>
        <LI>
        <P>If the Mobile Companion status icon does not display after a driver and Mobile Companion 
	installation in Windows 2000 or XP, restart the system or remove and reinsert the adapter. 
	Windows 2000 users require Windows Service Pack #4 and Windows XP users require Service Pack 
	#1 for full feature functionality. </P>
        <LI>
        <P>If reinserting a Symbol LA-4137 CF adapter into a Windows Mobile 2003 device, the Mobile 
	Companion icon may not display in the task tray. Remove and reinsert the adapter to display the Mobile 
	Companion icon. </p> 
 	<LI>
        <P>On HP H2215 iPAQs (running either Mobile Companion or using Zero Config), the adapter could 
	stop working. Remove and reinsert the adapter to restore functionality. </p>
	<LI>
        <P>Symbol LA-4121 and LA-4137 adapters cannot authenticate or a high number of dropped packets 
	can occur when associated to a Cisco AP1200 access point in PSP mode. When a Symbol LA-4121 PC Card 
	or LA-4137 CF card adapter is in any PSP mode, it sends out a NULL data frame to notify the access point 
	its associated to that it is in PSP mode. Cisco AP1200 access points disregard this request and still 
	send out a packet to the adapter as if it were in continuously aware mode (CAM). Change the adapter 
	from PSP mode to CAM to rectify. </P>
	<LI>
        <P>When a Symbol adapter is associated to an AP set to mandatory association, the Known AP list 
	appears empty when it roams out of range or disassociates from the mandatory AP. Without any APs 
	in the Known AP list, the user cannot change the setting to Set Roaming. Open the WLAN Profiles 
	property page and connect to a profile. This correctly displays the Known AP list. The Mandatory 
	association feature is not recommended in environments where roaming between APs is required. </P>
        <LI>
        <P>When a Symbol adapter is associated to an AP set to mandatory association and the adapter goes 
	out of range or is disassociated from the AP, it cannot reassociate to it when it is in range, or if 
	the AP becomes available. Open WLAN Profiles and connect to a profile. This correctly displays the 
	Known AP list. The Mandatory association feature is not recommended in environments where roaming 
	between APs is required. Mandatory association is designed to test the range and association between 
	a wireless client and AP and should not be used during normal operation. </P> 
	<LI>
        <P>Computer hangs have been encountered during LA-4121 PC Card installations on HP EVO 800 and 
	500 notebook computers running Windows 2000 (both Mobile Companion and driver only installations). 
	Before installing Mobile Companion (or just the driver), disable the PCI to USB enhanced host 
	controller driver. Install Mobile Companion (or just the driver). Re-enable the PCI to USB enhanced 
	host controller driver. Open the Device Manager. Select the Symbol LA-4121 PC Card and open its 
	properties. Click on the Resources tab. Unselect "Use Automatic Settings" and click "Change Settings...". 
	Change the value fields to a different range until there are no conflicts with other devices. 
	Click OK to save the changes. A dialog box displays prompting "Do you want to Continue?" Click Yes. </P>
	<LI>
        <P>On computers using an Intel Centrino, an error message displays during Mobile Companion or 
	driver-only installations. Uninstall the Intel Sebring API before installing Mobile Companion 
	or the driver. This disables the Intel Centrino feature on the computer. Install the Symbol 
	software again. </P>
	<LI>
        <P>The "Roll Back Driver" feature in Windows XP is not available when upgrading from Mobile Companion 
	(version 3.7) to Mobile Companion 3.9.2. If the "Roll Back Driver" feature is required, the user must 
	install the driver only for the Symbol adapter using Windows Plug and Play. Uninstall Mobile Companion 
	and reinstall the adapter using Windows Plug and Play to use the Roll Back Driver feature. </P>
        <LI>
        <P>Computer hangs have been identified on HP Omni notebook computers using the LA-4121 PC Card 
	(both Windows XP and 2000 with either Mobile Companion or driver only). To rectify, disable 
	or uninstall the modem before installing Mobile Companion. Install Mobile Companion or just the 
	driver. Re-enable the modem. Open the Device Manager. Select the Symbol LA-4121 PC Card and open 
	its properties. Click on the Resources tab. Unselect "Use Automatic Settings" and click 
	"Change Settings...". Change the value fields to a different range until there are no conflicts 
	with other devices. Click OK to save the changes. A dialog box displays prompting "Do you want 
	to Continue?" Click Yes. </P>
        <LI>
        <P>An EVMON error could appear when inserting a Symbol adapter. This has been observed when 
	Mobile Companion or the driver was initially installed with a LA-4121 PC Card adapter and 
	then a LA-4137 CF card adapter was used. Close the EVMON error dialog box. This event does not 
	affect performance or functionality.</p> 
 	<LI>
        <P>If the Mobile Companion icon remains in the task tray after the adapter is ejected, wait 
	about 30 seconds and the icon will close.</p></LI></UL>
