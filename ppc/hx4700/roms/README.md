Here's my ROM pack: https://mega.nz/file/WNsmVJ5Q#WvZIZj3acIK8eEj3JR4A11ectbpM7eb8Ek7pOwsb1T0

Has: WM2003 SE (OEM), WM5 (OEM), WM6.1, WM6.5 (Spiaatie), WM6.5.3 (Spiattie)

I use WM6.5 (Spiaatie) on my HX4700 and WM6.1 on my iPAQ 211. WM6.1 is much faster and smoother but WM6.5 is more modern. You can shuffle around like I do from time to time.
